    "Este relatório apresenta uma avaliação comparativa (benchmark) de diferentes modelos utilizados processar e armazenar ficheiros de áudio em bases de dados vetoriais (Milvus). Ao longo deste notebook interativo, será possível analisar o desempenho de cada modelo/embedding, permitindo perceber qual deles se adapta melhor às nossas necessidades. No final, será possível eleger o modelo ou embedding mais adequado para o nosso caso específico.\n"

    "## Explicação do Sistema de Ranking dos Modelos de Embeddings\n",
    "O sistema de ranking implementado no notebook oferece uma visão comparativa detalhada sobre o desempenho dos diferentes modelos de embeddings de áudio. Vamos explicar o significado dos valores apresentados e como interpretá-los:\n",
    "\n",
    "Rankings Individuais por Métrica:\n",
    "- Tempo de Extração (s)\n",
    "Representa quanto tempo cada modelo leva para processar o áudio e gerar o embedding\n",
    "Valores menores são melhores (indicam processamento mais rápido)\n",
    "Um modelo com tempo de extração baixo é ideal para aplicações em tempo real ou processamento em lote de grandes coleções de áudio\n",
    "- Tempo de Inserção (s)\n",
    "Mede quanto tempo leva para armazenar o embedding na base de dados Milvus\n",
    "Valores menores são melhores\n",
    "Geralmente menos crítico que o tempo de extração, mas importante para fluxos de ingestão de dados em grande escala\n",
    "- Pico de Memória (MB)\n",
    "Indica a quantidade máxima de memória RAM utilizada durante o processamento\n",
    "Valores menores são melhores (menos recursos consumidos)\n",
    "Crítico para ambientes com recursos limitados ou aplicações que precisam processar muitos arquivos simultaneamente\n",
    "- Uso de CPU (%)\n",
    "Porcentagem de utilização da CPU durante o processamento\n",
    "Valores menores são melhores\n",
    "Modelos com menor uso de CPU deixam mais recursos disponíveis para outras tarefas\n",
    "- Uso de RAM (%)\n",
    "Percentual total de memória do sistema utilizada\n",
    "Valores menores são melhores\n",
    "Diferente do \"Pico de Memória\" que é específico do processo\n",
    "- Dimensionalidade\n",
    "Tamanho do vetor de embedding gerado\n",
    "Não é classificado como \"melhor\" ou \"pior\" diretamente\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings maiores (maior dimensionalidade) podem capturar mais informações, mas:\n",
    "Consomem mais espaço de armazenamento\n",
    "Podem ser mais lentos para pesquisa\n",
    "Podem exigir mais recursos computacionais\n",
    "Ranking Geral\n",
    "Pontuação (0-100)\n",
    "Representa uma avaliação holística do desempenho do modelo\n",
    "Valores maiores são melhores (mais próximo de 100 = desempenho ideal)\n",
    "Calculada usando uma média ponderada normalizada das métricas principais\n",
    "Pesos das Métricas no Ranking Geral\n",
    "O ranking geral usa a seguinte distribuição de pesos:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tempo de extração: 35% (mais peso devido à sua importância crítica)\n",
    "Pico de memória: 25% (segundo mais importante)\n",
    "Uso de CPU: 20% (impacto moderado)\n",
    "Tempo de inserção: 15% (menos crítico que a extração)\n",
    "Uso de RAM total: 5% (menor peso pois depende de outros fatores do sistema)\n",
    "Processo de Normalização\n",
    "Para criar um ranking justo, o sistema:\n",
    "\n",
    "Normaliza cada métrica para uma escala de 0-1 (onde 0 é o melhor valor)\n",
    "Aplica os pesos definidos para cada métrica\n",
    "Inverte a escala final para que valores maiores (próximos de 100) sejam melhores\n",
    "Interpretação dos Resultados\n",
    "Primeiro lugar (ouro): Representa o modelo com melhor equilíbrio entre velocidade, eficiência de recursos e desempenho\n",
    "Segundo lugar (prata): Bom desempenho geral, possível alternativa ao primeiro colocado\n",
    "Terceiro lugar (bronze): Desempenho aceitável, pode ser útil em cenários específicos\n",
    "Demais posições: Podem ser adequadas para casos de uso específicos, dependendo da prioridade (velocidade vs. qualidade vs. recursos)\n",
    "É importante notar que o ranking geral oferece uma visão equilibrada, mas a escolha do melhor modelo ainda depende das prioridades específicas do seu projeto. Por exemplo, se você tem restrições severas de memória, pode preferir um modelo que não está no topo do ranking geral, mas que tem excelente desempenho na métrica de consumo de memória."
